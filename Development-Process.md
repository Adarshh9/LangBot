## Development Process Documentation

### Introduction

In this document, I will outline the development process of creating a chatbot application using Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and LangChain/Hugging Face for the natural language processing capabilities.

### 1. Initial Planning and Research

- **Objective**: The goal was to build a chatbot that could answer user queries and analyze uploaded documents.
- **Research**: Explored different NLP platforms and libraries, including OpenAI's embeddings and Hugging Face's language models.

### 2. Model Selection and Training

- **Initial Attempt**: Initially attempted to use OpenAI's embeddings for the chatbot but encountered quota limitations.
- **LangChain Exploration**: Discovered LangChain for building NLP models efficiently.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Used Hugging Face's language model (google-flan-t5-large) and fine-tuned it with custom data.
- **Model Size Considerations**: Opted for a smaller model due to system storage limitations, but noted that larger models could improve accuracy.

### 3. Flask Backend Development

- **Route Setup**: Created routes in Flask for handling user queries and document uploads.
- **Error Handling**: Faced syntax errors initially but resolved them by referring to documentation and online resources.
- **Postman Testing**: Used Postman to test the Flask routes and ensure they were functioning correctly.

### 4. Frontend Development

- **UI Design**: Designed a simple chatbot UI using HTML and CSS.
- **JavaScript Implementation**: Developed JavaScript functions to handle user interactions, such as sending queries and uploading documents.
- **Debugging**: Encountered errors while writing the JavaScript code but resolved them through trial and error and debugging.

### 5. Integration and Testing

- **Integration**: Integrated the frontend and backend components to create a cohesive application.
- **Testing**: Conducted testing to ensure all features were working as expected, including sending queries, uploading documents, and receiving responses from the chatbot.

### 6. Deployment and Finalization

- **Deployment**: Deployed the application to a server to make it accessible to users.
- **Documentation**: Documented the development process, including key learning points and challenges encountered, for future reference.

### Conclusion

The development of the chatbot application was a challenging but rewarding experience. Through the process, I gained valuable insights into natural language processing techniques, model training, Flask backend development, and frontend design. The project also introduced me to powerful NLP tools like LangChain and Hugging Face, which I can leverage in future projects. Overall, it was a successful endeavor that expanded my skills and knowledge in the field of NLP and web development.
